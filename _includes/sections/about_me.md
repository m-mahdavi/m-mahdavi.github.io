## About Me

I am a Professor of Data Science at Gisma University of Applied Sciences in Potsdam, Germany. My research focuses on designing effective and efficient data science systems for heterogeneous datasets, covering key areas such as applied machine learning and natural language processing. I have had the privilege of publishing my work in leading data science and mining conferences, including PVLDB, SIGMOD, and CIKM. I was also honored with the ACM SIGMOD Most Reproducible Paper Award.

I earned my PhD with Summa Cum Laude from TU Berlin in 2020. Prior to that, I completed my MSc in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Tehran and my BSc in Computer Engineering at the Iran University of Science and Technology.
